## Stock Basics

What is stock? 
* Stock = ownership stake in a company
* A share of stock = a share in the ownership of the company
* % of outstanding stock you own = % of the company oyu own
* Outstanding stock = number of shares issued by a company that are actually owned by someone (or by another company)
* Stock is also referred to as "Equity" 

### Stock Ownership Example #1

You start a company (formed as a corporation) with a friend. she has $2500 to put into the company, and you have $7500. you and her decide to issue 10,000 shares at $1 per share

* You own 7,500 shares
* 7500/10000 = .75 therefore, you own 75% of the company
    - you control the company
    - you likely have final say on all company matters.

So who does own Amazon? Institutions (mostly mutual fund companies) own 69% of Amazon

## Financial Markets

* Primary Markets
    * Transaction takes place directly between issuer and investor
        * Ex. your small corporation from example 1 decides to bring on a 3rd member, and you sell 5k directly to him

* Secondary Markets
    * Transaction takes place between investors
        * New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, etc.
        * Ex. You buy 10 shares of amazon as in example 2 through your online brokerage account. You are actually buying the shares from another investor who wants to sell their shares, not from amazon

### How does a company sell its stock?

#### Small companies
* The owners themselves find an investor willing to buy the shares, negotiate a price, and the investor pays the company directly for the stock

#### Large companies
* Companies that meet certain size requirements can have their stock listed on an exchange (NYSE, etc.)
    * When the company wants to sell additional shares of its stock, it actually sells them to a large brokerage firm (or firms) who pay the company directly
    * brokerage firm sells stock directly to invesors or sells them through an exchange

### Why issue stock?

* Pros:
    * Unlike when the company incurs debt, it does not have to pay money back to purchasers of stock
    * Easier for good companies to attract investors who want an ownership stake

* Cons: 
    * Current owners are giving up a piece of their stake in the company
    * Equity investors usually requre a higher potential return than bond investors, thus initial stock selling prices must reflect this
    * Dividents are not tax-deductivle, unlike interest payments on loans or bonds (Double Taxation)


### Features of Common Stock

* Voting rights
* Proxy voting
* Classes of stock
* Other rights
    * Share proportionally in dividends paid
    * Share proportionally in remaining assets after liquidation
    * The right to vote on stockholder matters of great importance, such as merger. Voting is usually done at the annual meeting or a special meeting
    * Preemptive right - first shot at new stock issue to maintain proportional ownership if desired


## Fundamentals of Corportate Debt

### Current Liabilities (short-term debt):
* In this class, we will only be concerned with the following types of current liabilities:
    * Accounts payable (money the company owes to vendors)
    * Loans Outstanding (typically to banks)
    * Current portion of Long-term Debt (payable in next 12 months)
        * Final 2 categories will always bwe aggregated into **Other Current Liabilities**

### Long-Term Liabilities:
* In this class, `Long-Term Liabilities` will always mean bonds outstanding

## Bond Basics

### What is a bond? 

* Bond = a contact between a borrower and investor 
* Bonds typically involve repaying a set amount of money at a specified date in the future, and usually (but not always) make interest payments to the holder in the meantime
* interest payments made by the company are tax deductivle
* Bond holders do not have an ownership stake in the company (they are just lenders and not owners)
* Bonds can be traded between investors the same way as stocks

### Why issue bonds? 

* Pros: 
    * Selling bonds does not force current owners to give up (or reduce) management or ownership control of the company
    * Unlike stock, bonds have a limited life
    * Since the company can deduct interest payments from income for tax purposes, the cost to the company of issuing and holding debt in the form of bonds is typically lower than that of stock

* Cons:
    * Interest payments must be made, can reduce company's liquidity and can even force company into bankruptcy
    * Unlike stockholders, the company is obligated to make a payment to bondholders at a specified period of time
    * May be harder to sell bonds than stock in certain circumstances

### Bond Ratings

* **Investment Grade Bond Ratings**
    * High Grade
        * Moody's AAA and S&P AAA - capacity to pay is extremely strong
        * Moody's AA and S&P AA - capacity to pay is very strong
    * Medium Grade
        * Moody's A and S&P A - capacity to pay is strong but more susceptible to changes in circumstances
        * Moody's Baa and S&P BBB - capacity to pay is adequate, adverse conditions will have more impact on the firms ability to pay
* **Non Investment Grade Bond Ratings:**
    * Low Grade
        * Moody's Ba and B
        * S&P BB and B
        * Considered possible that the capacity to pay will degenerate
